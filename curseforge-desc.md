While playing pickup sticks with your cat, an enevelope slides under the door nearest to you. No. Not that door. The other door. To the left. Yes. That's the door. When you open the envelope, you find the following letter and a very flat piece of green circuit board with a small red button on it:

To Whom It May Concern,

We at CipraTech congratulate you on formulating the idea that it was necessary to purchase this CipraTech branded Virtual Voxel World.

Sincerely,

After you finish reading the letter, you decide that the red button is _not_ something you want to push. But then your cat gets on your shoulder and paws at the fascinating circuit board in your hand. You suddenly appear in a very blocky world with fancy music playing from the sky and a tree in front of you begging you to punch it.

Don't worry. Your cat is safe back at home still pawing at the circuit board until it ends up under the refrgierator with that candy wrapper from 1998.
